    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>Whenever an expression is evaluated during the run of a Scheme program,
    there is a continuation awaiting the values of the expression. It is a
    distinguishing property of the Scheme programming language to offer a
    procedure (named <code>call/cc</code>) that captures the current
    continuation as a procedure, which, when called, aborts the then current
    continuation and reinstates the captured one.</p>

    <p>One can visualize a continuation as a list of (continuation) frames
      where a non-tail call adds a frame to the top of the list and where the return
      from a non-tail call removes the appropriate frame.</p>

    <p>Moreover, each expression is evaluated in a dynamic environment that
      conceptually holds the values of parameters like the current output port
      and the dynamic-wind stack at the point of evaluation.  As the dynamic
      environment is captured and reinstated along the continuation when the
      <code>call/cc</code> machinery is used, we can view it conceptually as
      part of the continuation.</p>

    <p>The libraries defined in this SRFI are all concerned with continuations
      in a wider sense. More specifically, the topics are as follows:</p>

    <p><i>Continuation Prompts:</i> A continuation prompt is a special
    continuation frame, which is tagged with a so-called prompt tag. Procedures
    to install continuation prompts and to abort the current continuation and
    to escape back to a previously installed continuation prompt are
    provided. Moreover, continuation prompts are equipped with handlers that
    are invoked when a continuation is aborted to them.</p>

    <p><i>Continuations:</i> When continuations are captured, the list of
    captured continuation frames are always delimited by some continuation
    prompt. This extends the semantics of Scheme’s
    <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.  Moreover, a
    procedure to capture so-called composable continuations is
    provided. As opposed to continuations captured
    by <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, invoking a
    composable continuation does not abort the then current
    continuation, so composable continuations behave like ordinary
    procedures.  Together with continuation prompts, composable
    continuations allow one to implement the various proposed sets of
    control operators for delimited continuations. Finally, a
    primitive (<code>call-in-continuation</code>) is provided that
    allows calling a procedure in a given continuation instead of just
    delivering values to it.</p>

    <p><i>Continuation Marks:</i> Continuation marks are a provided feature
      that allows one to attach arbitrary information to continuation frames,
      which are captured and reinstated along the rest of the
      continuation. Conceptually, exception handlers and parameters are
      implemented in terms of continuation marks, but the syntax and procedures
      defined in this SRFI allow the user to use them in more general
      ways. Moreover, they reify the notion of a tail call, allowing, for
      example, to test for tail context.</p>

    <p><i>Exceptions:</i> The exception mechanism
    of <a href="#sperber"><cite>R6RS</cite></a>
    and <a href="#shinn"><cite>R7RS</cite></a> is reinterpreted with
    respect to the concepts introduced in this SRFI.  Moreover, the
    <code>with-exception-handler</code> procedure and the <code>guard</code>
    syntax gain additional tail context guarantees.</p>

    <p><i>Parameters:</i> The parameter object mechanism
    of <a href="#feeley2"><cite>SRFI 39</cite></a>
    and <cite>R7RS</cite> is reinterpreted with respect to the
    concepts introduced in this SRFI.  Procedures to retrieve the
    current parameterization and to reinstall it later are
    provided. Moreover, the <code>parameterize</code> syntax gains an
    additional tail context guarantee.  To support an alternative
    model of parameters that is linked to the dynamic extent and not
    to the current parameterization, the notion of a parameter-like
    object and the <code>with</code> syntax are introduced.</p>

    <p><i>Fluids:</i> Fluids are a syntactic reinterpretation of parameter
      objects.</p>

    <p><i>Delayed evaluation:</i> The syntax and procedures on delayed
      evaluation of <cite>R7RS</cite> are revisited and redefined to handle the
      following satisfactorily: the parameterization of the delayed expression
      being forced, the treatment of exceptions raised during forcing of
      delayed expressions, and iterative lazy algorithms. Moreover, their
      semantics are detailed with respect to the concepts introduced in this
      SRFI, and promises can naturally deliver an arbitrary number of values
      when being forced. Finally, the initial continuation of a delayed
      expression being forced is defined in a way that makes it interchangeably
      with the initial continuation of a thread.</p>

    <p><i>Threads:</i> The thread mechanism
      of <a href="#feeley1"><cite>SRFI 18</cite></a> is detailed with
      respect to the concepts introduced in this SRFI.  In particular,
      mutation of parameter objects in multi-threaded applications is
      specified.  In order to support timeout arguments in a type-safe
      way, a minimal API on time objects is included as well.</p>

    <p>Large parts of this SRFI have been inspired by the control operators
      provided by <a href="#racket"><cite>Racket</cite></a>.

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Move <code>continuation?</code>
          and <code>non-composable-continuation?</code> in an
          introspection library.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add <code>(srfi :226 control reset-shift)</code>
      library.</p></li>
      <li><p>A brief table of contents should be added before the
	  final draft.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add library names to each entry.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>The aim of this SRFI is to provide a consistent set of control
      operators and related syntax and procedures vastly extending the
      scope of the venerable pair of <code>call/cc</code>
      and <code>dynamic-wind</code>.  The procedures and syntax in
      this SRFI can be provided as
      <a href="#sperber"><cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite></a> or as
      <a href="#shinn"><cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite></a> libraries.
      Although a portable implementation is not possible, it is
      demonstrated by the sample implementation that
      a <a href="#sample-implementation">small set of primitives</a>,
      which can easily be provided by any Scheme implementation,
      suffices to implement the rich operators in this SRFI.</p>

    <p>The theoretical concepts behind the operators described in this
      specification are well understood and not new.  The author of this SRFI
      does not claim any originality for any idea presented here, but is lucky
      to be able to stand on the shoulders of giants.  (See the various
      references in <a href="#dybvig"><cite>A Monadic Framework for Delimited
      Continuations</cite></a>, for example.)</p>

    <p>Whenever this document refers to just <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>,
      the small language is meant as the large language is still a work in
      progress as the time of writing of this SRFI.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>In detail, the contributions of this SRFI are the following:</p>

    <h4>Continuations and Prompts</h4>

    <p>As explained in <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite> and
      <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>, whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated,
       there is a <dfn>continuation</dfn> wanting the result of the expression.
       We can view a continuation as a sequence of active procedure calls.
       Evaluation steps alter the current continuation.  Calls add an active
       procedure call to the current continuation, while returns remove an
       active procedure call.
    </p>

    <p>Certain control operations can change the current continuation
      more radically.  The Scheme procedure <code>call/cc</code>
      allows capturing the current continuation and reifies it into a
      procedure that, when later called, abandons the then-current
      continuation and replaces it with the captured one.</p>

    <p>Conceptually, only an end segment of the current continuation is ever
      replaced.  For example, when running a Scheme program, running a thread,
      or evaluating an expression at the REPL prompt, the old and the new
      current continuation always share an initial segment at least up to the
      point when the program was started, the thread was started, or the
      expression was sent to the REPL.</p>

    <p>Therefore, <code>call/cc</code> never has to, nor actually does,
      capture the whole current continuation, but only an end segment.
      Reinstating the captured continuation means to replace the end
      segment of the then-current continuation.</p>

    <p>With <code>call/cc</code> alone, the programmer has no control over the
      size of this end segment.  This SRFI offers operators to do exactly this.
      With these operators, the programmer can install <dfn>continuation
      prompts</dfn> identified by <dfn>prompt tags</dfn> in the current
      continuation.  When a continuation is later captured, it is delimited by
      the nearest continuation prompt with a given prompt tag.  Default prompts
      are installed at the start of each program, the start of each thread, and
      when promises are forced.</p>

    <p>The reason that continuation prompts are called <i>prompts</i>
      is that ​a continuation as we know from Scheme is usually
      delimited at the <i>prompt</i> of the REPL.  In a strict sense,
      an undelimited continuation does not return by definition.  But
      this is not true for an actual continuation returned by even the
      venerable <code>call/cc</code>.  When it is invoked, it will
      deliver value at the REPL prompt.  (And when the program may not
      have been running from a REPL, the prompt is that of the shell
      or some HALT instruction.)  A <i>prompt</i> as defined by this
      document just extends this scenario.</p>

    <h4>Composable and Non-Composable Continuations</h4>

    <p>When a continuation captured
      with <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> is later
      invoked, the invocation never returns to this call's
      continuation.  In this sense, such a continuation procedure is
      far from being a function in the mathematical sense, as it
      doesn't deliver any values.  In particular, it cannot be
      composed.  For that reason, continuations captured
      by <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> are also
      called <dfn>non-composable continuations</dfn>.</p>

    <p>This SRFI offers an
      operator <code>call-with-composable-continuation</code> that also captures
      the current continuation, but reifies it into a different type of
      continuation, a <dfn>composable continuation</dfn>.  Contrary to
      non-composable continuations, a composable continuation, when invoked,
      does not abort any active procedure call, but just extends the then-current
      continuation.  In particular, it delivers values to the
      continuation of the call to it.  A composable continuation therefore
      behaves like an ordinary procedure.</p>

    <h4>Continuation Marks</h4>

    <p><dfn>Continuation marks</dfn> are a feature that allows attaching
      information in the form of key-value pairs to individual continuation
      frames, which are maximal segments of continuations of a number of active
      tail calls followed by at most one active non-tail call.  The set of
      continuation marks of the continuation frames of a continuation belongs
      to this continuation and is thus also captured
      by <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>
      and <code>call-with-composable-continuation</code>.</p>

    <p>Continuation marks can be used to implement exception handlers,
      parameter objects, and an implementation of <code>delay</code>
      and <code>force</code> of <a href="#kelsey1"><cite>R<sup>5</sup>RS</cite></a>
      that supports iterative lazy algorithms.</p>

    <p>A crucial feature of continuation marks is that they allow one
      to attach marks to the most recent continuation frame without
      creating active non-tail calls.  This allows one to implement
      a <code>parameterize</code> form where the last expression in
      its body is in tail context when the <code>parameterize</code>
      form is in tail position.  Similarly, it becomes possible to
      implement <code>with-exception-handler</code> in a way so that
      its thunk is called in tail context if the call
      to <code>with-exception-handler</code> is in tail context.
      The latter is not guaranteed by <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite>
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> (but should have according to
      the author of this SRFI).</p>

    <p>In fact, with continuation marks, the concept of tail calls becomes
      operationally observable.</p>

    <h4>Continuations and Threads</h4>

    <p>The concept of threads and the semantics of multi-threaded
      programs are deeply linked with the concepts that are involved
      in this specification.  For example, each thread possesses an
      initial continuation, containing a continuation prompt with a
      handler that has to be described.  For that, this specification
      contains a specification of a thread system mostly
      API-compatible with <cite>SRFI 18</cite> (and that exist
      alongside <cite>SRFI 18</cite>).  This helps making the
      existence of multiple threads, continuations, continuation
      prompts, and parameterizations mutually compatible.</p>

    <h4>Parameter Objects</h4>

    <p>Parameter objects are a tool to provide dynamically-scoped variables to
      the Scheme language in a clean way.  As a definition of parameter objects
      in terms of continuation marks is possible, and as an implementation in
      terms of them allows rich operations like capturing the current
      parameterization to later reinstall it, this SRFI provides both.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this specification makes a decision on the behavior
      of mutable ordinary parameter objects with respect to multiple
      threads.  If a parameter that is inherited by a newly created
      thread and has not been re-parameterized is mutated by one of
      the threads, the mutation will also (eventually) be observed by
      the other thread.  This is a clear semantics because this is the
      same behavior as implemented by lexical variables.  If this is
      not the desired behavior for some application, thread parameter
      objects, that are also provided, can be used instead.</p>

    <p>A different model of parameters exist, the main difference
      being the scope of the reparameterization.  This SRFI also
      supports this different model through the notion of
      parameter-like objects and the <code>with</code> syntax, where
      the reparameterization is bound to the dynamic extent of
      the <code>with</code> form's body.</p>

    <h4>Fluids</h4>

    <p>Parameter objects behave like (dynamic) variables except that
      they are procedures that have to be called to retrieve the
      stored value or to replace it.  In some (syntactic) contexts, it
      may be preferable to have syntactic entities, the fluids, that
      behave like parameter objects but whose syntax to reference or
      assign their values is equivalent to the corresponding syntax
      for variables.</p>

    <p>Fluids have been proposed by <a href="#hansen"><cite>SRFI
          15</cite></a>.  That SRFI was withdrawn.  This SRFI addresses all
      concerns that were raised on the mailing list of <cite>SRFI
        15</cite> about the behavior of fluids and <code>fluid-let</code>
      with respect to multi-threaded environments.</p>

    <h4>Thread locals</h4>

    <p>Although they have been proposed for this application,
      parameter objects are unsuited to provide thread-local cells.  The
      main reason is that the current parameterization is part of the
      current continuation.  As the current continuation can be captured
      and reinstated in any thread, the parameterization cannot be a
      per-thread entity.</p>

    <p>Instead, this specification defines first-class thread locals
      akin to thread-specific storage in the <a href="c17"><cite>C
      programming language</cite></a> and to thread-specific data keys
      in <cite>POSIX</cite>.  In particular, the former can be
      efficiently implemented in terms of the latter.  Thread locals
      can be <i>inheritable</i> or not (called <i>preserved</i> in
      Racket).  Inheritable thread locals take their initial values
      from the creator thread.</p>

    <h4>Promises</h4>

    <p>A naive implementation of <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code> does
      not support iterative lazy algorithms as was observed, for example,
      in <a href="#van-tonder"><cite>SRFI 45</cite></a>.  That SRFI
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> solve the problem by providing another
      primitive, <code>delay-force</code> (called <code>lazy</code>
      in <cite>SRFI 45</cite>).  When continuation marks are available,
      however, such an irksome primitive is not needed;
      see <a href="#nieper2">SRFI 155</a>.  Consequently, this specification
      defines <dfn>promises</dfn> in a way that makes <code>delay-force</code>
      superfluous.</p>

    <p>Moreover, this specification amends <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> in a
      way that defines the continuation in which the values of promises are
      forced in such a way that it has the same semantics as executing a
      thread.  This makes the overall system pleasantly coherent.  The sample
      implementation shows how everything can be implemented efficiently.</p>

    <p>Finally, promises as defined in this specification can deliver multiple
      values when forced, an extension too natural to ignore, and it is
      clearly specified what happens when an exception is raised during the
      forcing of a promise.</p>

    <h3>Relation to Other Standards</h3>

    <p>This specification is meant to be applicable to both
      standards, <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite>
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>.  The former standard allows
      the use of square brackets synonymous with parentheses in the
      syntax.  In its non-normative appendix C, advice is given in
      which places in the syntactic forms specified in the report they
      should be used.  In order to document in which places square
      brackets should be used in the syntactic forms described in this
      specification, this document uses them in the appropriate
      places.  When this specification is applied
      to <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>, the square brackets should be
      read as parentheses.</p>

    <p>Some of the procedures and syntax defined in this specification
      have the same names as procedures and syntax
      of <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite>
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>.  In case a definition of such
      a procedure or syntax here does not conflict with the
      corresponding definition in a Scheme report, the procedure or
      syntax should be the same whether exported by the relevant
      standard libraries or one of the libraries described below.</p>

    <h3>Relation to Other SRFIs</h3>

    <p>This SRFI supersedes <cite>SRFI 15</cite>, <a href="#kelsey2"><cite>SRFI
	  34</cite></a>, <cite>SRFI
	  39</cite>, <a href="#nieper1"><cite>SRFI
	  154</cite></a>, <cite>SRFI
	  155</cite>, and <a href="#nieper3"><cite>SRFI
	  157</cite></a>.</p>

    <p>The programming model defined by <cite>SRFI 18</cite> is
    extended.</p>

    <h3>Why this Proposal should be Incorporated as a Standard Feature
      in Scheme Implementations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><p>In many if not most cases, <code>call/cc</code> (as
	  defined in previous standards and without continuation
	  prompts) is the wrong abstraction, a fact that has been well
	  known for a long time (see <a href="#kiselyov"><cite>An
	  argument against call/cc</cite></a>).  The
	  procedure <code>call/cc</code>, which captures undelimited
	  continuations, is usually advertised as the hammer that can
	  be used to implement all other control operations.  However,
	  this is not true.  <i>Delimited continuations</i>, on the
	  other hand, can be used to implement all other control
	  operations (see <a href="#filinski"><cite>Representing
	  Monads</cite></a>).  So it is actually delimited
	  continuations that are needed in practice.  Now everything
	  would be fine if delimited control operators could be
	  expressed in terms of <code>call/cc</code>.  This, however,
	  is not faithfully possible, especially not without space
	  leaks, as <code>call/cc</code> will capture parts of the
	  continuation that will never be reached after reinstating
	  (see <a href="#gasbichler"><cite>Final Shift for Call/cc:
	  Direct implementation of Shift and Reset</cite></a>).  Thus,
	  in hindsight Scheme should have always offered delimited
	  control operators instead of
	  <code>call/cc</code>.  Implementing this SRFI remedies that.</p></li>
      <li><p>By implementing this SRFI, even <code>call/cc</code>
	  becomes a delimited control operator thanks to the concept
	  of continuation prompts and the fact that one is available
	  at the start of each thread, including the primordial thread.</p></li>
      <li><p>In the literature, many sets of delimited control
	  operators can be found, with varying expressiveness.
	  Instead of primarily providing some or all of these, it makes
	  more sense to provide abstractions on top of which all these,
	  like <code>reset</code> and <code>shift</code>, can be built.
	  This SRFI offers these abstractions to Scheme
	  implementations.</p></li>
      <li><p>The continuation marks as defined in this SRFI can be
	  used, just to give an example, to write high-level debugging
	  tools and can more generally be used to inspect and attach
	  data to continuations.  Moreover, they make the concept of
	  tail calls operationally visible to Scheme.  Finally, they
	  enable some higher-order procedures to tail-call their
	  argument; a good example for this
	  is <code>with-exception-handler</code>, which should
	  tail-call its thunk.  Continuation marks enable one to write
	  such a version.</p></li>
      <li><p>Consequently, this SRFI provides versions of exception
	  handlers with improved tail-call guarantees.  The issue
	  is not academic as the right tail-call guarantees are
	  crucial for writing iterative algorithms in Scheme.</p></li>
      <li><p>Similarly, the <code>parameterize</code> form is defined
	  in this SRFI so that its body's last expression is in tail
	  context (if the whole form is).  This is semantically the
	  correct thing because parameters are substitutes for
	  implicit lexical parameters and so the usual tail-call
	  guarantees should apply as well.</p></li>
      <li><p>Using continuation marks, this SRFI makes
	  the <code>delay-force</code> form superfluous, and writing
	  iterative lazy algorithms becomes natural.  Moreover,
	  forcing promises is defined in a way to make it fully
	  similar to running threads.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finally, the initial continuation of threads is carefully
	  defined so that this SRFI offers clear semantics of
	  continuations and continuation prompts with respect to
	  multi-threaded programs.</p></li>
      <li><p>The interactions between the various features in this
	  proposal (continuation prompts, continuations, exceptions,
	  parameter objects, threads) have been carefully considered
	  and their semantics have been designed accordingly.
	  Incorporating these features as defined (or a suitable
	  subset of these) in a Scheme implementation guarantees
	  consistency and coherence.</p></li>
      <li><p>As the sample implementation shows, the features defined
	  in this SRFI are not hard to implement in a Scheme
	  implementation, which must already
	  implement <code>call/cc</code> anyway.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation</h3>

    <p>The accompanying sample implementation does not implement the libraries
      defined in this specification, but it demonstrates how they can be as soon
      as a small set of easily implementable primitives are provided by the
      Scheme implementation.</p>

    <p>The sample implementation provides versions of all procedures and syntax
      described in this specification and allows playing with them.  A runnable
      test suite is also provided.</p>

    <p>The sample implementation is written in the Scheme dialect
      of <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite> because it is supposed to be run
      on <a href="#chezscheme"><cite>Chez Scheme</cite></a>, an implementation
      of that Scheme dialect.  However, the code should be easily adaptable to
      any other Scheme dialect.  In fact, the goal of the sample implementation
      is to enable Scheme implementers to add the procedures and syntax defined
      in this SRFI to their Scheme implementations with little effort.</p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Libraries</h3>

    <p>The syntax and procedures defined below are provided by
      sublibraries within <code>(srfi :226 control)</code>
      (see <a href="#van-horn"><cite>SRFI 97</cite></a>).</p>

    <p>The <code>(srfi :226)</code> and <code>(srfi :226
      control)</code> library is a composite of the sublibraries
      described in this specification.</p>

    <p>In an implementation of <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>, the
      composite library is named <code>(srfi 226)</code> instead, and
      the component libraries are within the namespace <code>(srfi
      226)</code> instead of <code>(srfi 226 :control)</code>.
      Moreover, the library name parts are in the singular where
      applicable.</p>

    <p>It is expected that a future Scheme standard building on the
      procedures and syntax defined in this document will choose a
      different packaging into libraries, possibly fewer ones.</p>

    <h3>Iterators</h3>

    <p>An <dfn>iterator</dfn> for a list in the sense of this
      specification is a zero-argument procedure that returns two
      values on each invocation.  An iterator for the empty list
      returns <code>#f</code> and a thunk that raises an exception of
      type <code>&amp;assertion-violation</code> when invoked.  An
      iterator for a non-empty list returns the head of the list and
      an iterator for its tail.  Note that this particular iterator
      protocol is unsuitable for lists that potentially
      contain <code>#f</code>.</p>

    <h3>Safety</h3>

    <p>The libraries described by this SRFI are <i>safe libraries</i>
      in the sense of <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite>.  In particular, in
      the presence of multiple threads, concurrent reading and writing
      to a location must not threaten system integrity in ways that
      might result in execution that is inconsistent with the
      semantics described in the Scheme reports and in this document.
      All modifications to single locations in the store must appear
      atomic to each thread.</p>

    <h4>Conditions</h4>

    <p><i>Note:</i> If this SRFI is implemented in a system that does not
      support the condition system of <cite>R6RS</cite>, the respective parts
      of this specification should be applied <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.  We
      follow the presentation style of <cite>R6RS</cite> for the condition
      types defined in this and the other libraries.</p>

    <h4>Prompt Tags</h4>

    <h4>Continuation Prompts</h4>

    <p>We identify a <dfn>continuation</dfn> with a sequence of active
      procedure calls, beginning with the most recent call.  A
      continuation can be uniquely partitioned into
      <dfn>continuation frames</dfn>, which are maximal subsequences
      of active procedure calls containing an arbitrary number of
      active tail calls followed by at most one active non-tail call.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>continuation prompt</dfn> is a type of continuation
      frame such that when values are delivered to a continuation
      extended by such a continuation frame, the values are
      effectively delivered to the non-extended continuation.
      Moreover, each continuation prompt is tagged with a
      prompt tag and records a <dfn>prompt handler</dfn>, which
      is a procedure.</p>

    <p>A continuation prompt with a given prompt tag
      is <dfn>available</dfn> in a continuation if a continuation
      prompt with the given tag is contained in the continuation's
      sequence of continuation frames.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(call-with-continuation-prompt <var>thunk</var>)</code></dt>

      <dt class="procedure"><code>(call-with-continuation-prompt <var>thunk</var> <var>prompt-tag</var> <var>abort-handler</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>If not supplied, <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code>
	  defaults to the default prompt tag,
	  and <code><var>abort-handler</var></code> defaults
	  to <code>#f</code>.</p>

	<p>The <code>call-with-continuation-prompt</code> procedure
	  installs a continuation prompt that is tagged
	  with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> and
	  records <code><var>abort-handler</var></code> in the continuation
	  to its call.  Finally, <code><var>thunk</var></code> is
	  called with no arguments in the resulting continuation.</p>

	<p>If <code><var>abort-handler</var></code> is <code>#f</code>, the
	  default abort handler is used instead.  The default abort handler is a
	  procedure that takes a single
	  argument <code><var>continuation-thunk</var></code>.  When the default
	  abort handler is called, it reinstates the continuation prompt and
	  calls <code><var>continuation-thunk</var></code> with no arguments in the
	  resulting continuation.</p>

	<p>The calls to the <code><var>thunks</var></code> are never in tail
	  context.</p>

	<p>The <code>abort-current-continuation</code> procedure
	  aborts all active procedure calls in the current
	  continuation until a continuation prompt tagged

	  prompt tag with the

	  When a continuation prompt tagged

	  with condition type <code>&amp;continuation</code> is

	<p><i>Note:</i> Even if a continuation prompt tagged
	  with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> is available in the
	  current continuation
	  when <code>abort-current-continuation</code> is called, due
	  to the presence of <code>dynamic-wind</code> winders (see
	  below) it can still happen during the aborting process that

    <h3>Continuations</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	continuations)</code> library.  This library, in addition to the
      procedures described here, also exports the condition types
      described in the previous section on continuation prompts.</p>

    <p>Each <dfn>continuation (procedure)</dfn> is a procedure.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(call-with-non-composable-continuation <var>proc</var> <var>prompt-tag</var>)</code></dt>
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(call-with-non-composable-continuation <var>proc</var>)</code></dt>

	<p>It is an error if <code><var>proc</var></code> does not accept one argument.</p>
	<p>The procedure <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code>
	  packages all active procedure calls in the current
	  continuation up to but not including a continuation prompt
	  tagged with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> as a
	  continuation (“escape”) procedure and passes it as an
	  argument to <code><var>proc</var></code>.  The continuation
	  procedure is a Scheme procedure such that, if it is later called,
	  aborts all active procedure calls in the then-current
	  continuation up to but not including a continuation prompt
	  with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> or up to but not
	  including an active procedure call shared by the current and
	  captured continuations, whichever comes first.  Finally, the
	  active procedure calls in the unshared portion of the
	  captured continuation are reinstated and the arguments
	  supplied to the call to the continuation procedure become
	  the result values for the new current continuation.
	</p>
	<p>We say that the continuation procedure
	is <dfn>delimited</dfn> by <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code>.</p>
	<p>If a call to <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code>
	occurs in a tail context, the call
	to <code><var>proc</var></code> is also in a tail context.</p>
	<p>If a continuation prompt tagged
	  with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> is not available in
	  the current continuation, an exception with condition
	  type <code>&amp;continuation</code> is raised.
	<p>If a continuation prompt tagged
	  with <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> is not available in
	  the current continuation when the continuation procedure is called, an exception with condition
	  type <code>&amp;continuation</code> is raised.</p>
	<p>The identifier <code>call/cc</code> is an alias
	for <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>, which does
	not take a <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code> argument.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> As a continuation prompt tagged with the
	  default prompt tag is available in the initial continuation
	  of each thread, including the primordial thread,
	  the <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code>
	  defined here is a conservative extension of
	  the <code>call-with-current-continuation</code> of earlier
	  Scheme reports.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The following example shows how continuation prompts delimit
      the captured continuation and the continuation to be replaced.</p>

    <pre class="example">(let ([tag (make-continuation-prompt-tag)])
  (* 2
   (call-with-continuation-prompt
    (lambda ()
      (* 3

    <p>When the continuation is captured in this example, all active
      procedure calls up to nearest (dynamically) enclosing prompt
      (tagged with the value of <code>tag</code>) are captured.
      Effectively, multiplication by <code>3</code> is captured.  When
      the continuation is invoked in this example, its active
      procedure calls are reinstated after the current continuation
      has been cut back to the nearest enclosing prompt at the point
      of invoking the captured continuation.  Effectively, the
      multiplication by <code>7</code> is removed and replaced by the
      captured multiplication by <code>3</code>.  In effect, this
      yields the value of <code>(* 2 (* 3 (* 5 (* 3 11))))</code>,
      which is <code>990</code>.</p>

	<p>The

	<p>We say that the continuation procedure
	is <dfn>delimited</dfn> by <code><var>prompt-tag</var></code>.</p>
	<p>If a call to <code>call-with-composable-continuation</code>

	<p><i>Note:</i> The difference between the continuation
	  procedure returned
	  by <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code>
	  and <code>call-with-composable-continuation</code> is that
	  the former removes portions of the then-current
	  continuation, while the latter does not.  The former
	  continuation procedures are called <dfn>non-composable
	  continuations</dfn>, while the latter are

	  usually return values to the continuation in which they are
	  called, while the former never do.</p>

    </dl>

    <p>The following example is similar to the previous one except
    that the call to <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code> is
    replaced with a call
    to <code>call-with-composable-continuation</code>.  Accordingly,
    invoking the captured continuation does not remove any active
    procedure calls and so the result of the second example
    is <code>7</code> times the value of the first.</p>

    <p>This concept of composable continuations together with the
      facility to install and abort to continuation prompts is rich
      enough to support the known delimited control operators.  For
      example, the control operators
      <code>reset</code> and <code>shift</code>
      from <a href="#danvy"><cite>Abstracting Control</cite></a> can be implemented as
      follows:</p>

    <pre class="example">(define-syntax reset
  (syntax-rules ()
    [(reset e1 e2 ...)

    <p><i>Remark:</i> In <a href="#feeley3"><cite>A better API for
      first-class continuations</cite></a> it is argued that
      (non-composable) continuations should form a type disjoint of
      that of procedures.  This has, at least, didactic advantages.
      While this SRFI does not take the radical step of not requiring
      that non-composable continuation objects are callable, the
      procedures <code>call-in</code> and <code>return-to</code>
      (corresponding to <code>continuation-graft</code>
      and <code>continuation-return</code> in the cited paper) can be
      used to write code that works without the assumption that
      non-composable continuation objects <code><var>k</var></code>
      are callable: Instead
      of <code>(<var>k</var> <var>obj</var>)</code> one
      writes <code>(return-to <var>k</var> <var>obj</var>)</code>,
      which has the obvious advantage that it becomes clear that the
      call does not return to its continuation.  This allows a
      possible future SRFI to deprecate or remove the callability of
      non-composable continuation objects, at least those returned
      by <code>call-with-non-composable-continuation</code>.

    <h3>Continuation Marks</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	continuation-marks)</code> library.  This library, in addition
	to the procedures described here, also exports the condition
	types described in the section on continuation prompts.</p>

    <h4>Continuation Marks</h4>

    <p>Continuation frames can be annotated with <dfn>continuation
	marks</dfn>.  Each continuation mark maps a key, which can be
	an arbitrary object, to a value, which can also be an
	arbitrary object.  If a continuation frame is annotated with a
	continuation mark for a key for which the continuation frame
	has already been annotated with a mark, the most recent
	annotation prevails.</p>

    <p><i>Remark:</i> In <cite>A better API for first-class
      continuations</cite>, the idea of a portable debugger using a procedure
      named <code>continuation-next</code> to walk up a continuation was
      presented.  With continuation marks this can be easily achieved when
      frames are explicitly marked.  The advantage of an explicit marking is
      that the debugger can then be instructed to automatically skip over
      frames installed by standard library procedures, for example.  A Scheme
      system could offer a debug mode, in which every frame is automatically
      marked in a specific way that is understood by the debugger.

    <h3>Parameter Objects</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	parameters)</code> library.</p>

    <p>Each <dfn>parameter object</dfn> is a procedure.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>parameterization</dfn> is an opaque mapping of parameter objects
    to cells that hold a value.</p>

    <p>Conceptually, each continuation contains at least one otherwise
      inaccessible parameterization continuation mark, whose value is
      a parameterization.  The <dfn>parameterization of a
      continuation</dfn> is the value of the most recent
      parameterization continuation mark in the continuation.  The
      parameterization of the current continuation is the <dfn>current
      parameterization</dfn>.  The (current) parameterization can
      conceptually be seen as part of the dynamic environment.</p>

    <p>The parameterization of the initial continuation of a top-level program
      maps each current and future parameter object to a cell holding its
      initial value.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(make-parameter <var>obj</var>)</code></dt>

	  procedure accepting zero or one argument and
	  whose <dfn>initial value</dfn> is the value and
	  whose <dfn>conversion procedure</dfn>
	  is <code><var>proc</var></code>.</p>
	<p>
	  When a parameter object is invoked with zero arguments, the content
	  of the cell of the parameter object in the parameterization of the
	  invocation is returned.
	</p>
	<p>When a parameter object is invoked with one argument, its
	  conversion function is applied to it in the dynamic
	  environment of the call to the parameter object to obtain a
	  new value.  The previous value contained in the cell of the
	  parameter object in the parameterization of the invocation
	  is then replaced with the new value.  The result of the

	  one of the obtained parameter objects is not actually a
	  parameter object.  The objects are then mapped to respective
	  values by invoking the conversion procedures of the
	  corresponding parameter objects in the dynamic environment
	  of the <code>parameterize</code> expression on them.  For
	  each parameter object, a newly allocated cell is then
	  constructed that holds the obtained corresponding value.  A
	  new parameterization that differs from the parameterization
	  of the continuation of the <code>parameterize</code>
	  expression in mapping the obtained parameter objects to the
	  respectively newly allocated cells is then constructed.
	  Finally, the most recent continuation frame in the
	  continuation of the <code>parameterize</code> expression is
	  annotated with a parameterization continuation mark whose

    <p>While the following example demonstrates many features of
      parameter objects, it should not be considered to illustrate good
      programming style.  Usually, the conversion procedure should be idempotent.</p>

    <pre class="example">(define p (make-parameter 10 (lambda (x) (* x x))))
(define ps #f)

      (p 0)
      (list x (p)))))<span class="result">(20736 0)</span>

(p)<span class="result">144</span></pre>

    <p>The following example shows how continuation marks can be used
    to test that the last expression in a <code>parameterize</code>
    body is in tail context if the <code>parameterize</code> expression itself is:</p>

<pre class="example">(with-continuation-mark 'in-tail-context? #t
  (parameterize ([(make-parameter 0) 1])
    (call-with-immediate-continuation-mark 'in-tail-context? values)))<span class="result">#t</span></pre>

    <p><i>Note:</i> The parameter objects defined in this
      specification are fully compatible with the parameter objects
      of <a href="#feeley2"><cite>SRFI 39</cite></a>
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> but add the requirement that
      the last expression in the body of a <code>parameterize</code>
      expression in tail context is in tail context as well.  With
      respect to multiple threads, this specification differs
      from <cite>Racket</cite> in that the cells associated with
      parameter objects are not “thread-local” in this specification.
      As has already been observed by Marc Feeley during the
      discussion period of <cite>SRFI 39</cite>, this is the cleaner,
      faster, and more expressive semantics.  Finally, the parameter
      objects defined here are not fully compatible with the
      parameters of <cite>Chez Scheme</cite>.  While these offer some
      features over the parameter objects in <cite>SRFI 39</cite>
      and <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite>, they would be incompatible
      with the tail-context guarantee of the <code>parameterize</code>
      form and with the parameterization as a first-class
      object.  <cite>Chez Scheme's</cite> <code>parameterize</code>
      mechanism is implemented by the <code>with</code> syntax
      below.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>parameter-like object</dfn> is a procedure <var>p</var>
      that can be invoked on zero and on one argument.  Calling it
      with zero arguments should return the parameter value associated
      with it; calling it with one argument should set the parameter
      value associated with it to the argument value.</p>

    <p>Each parameter object is a parameter-like object.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="syntax"><code>(with ([<span class="token">param-expr</span> <span class="token">expression</span>] &hellip;) <span class="token">body</span>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p><i>Syntax:</i>
	  The <code><span class="token">param-exprs</span></code> and

	<p><i>Semantics:</i> Evaluates
	  the <code><span class="token">param-exprs</span></code>
	  and <code><span class="token">expressions</span></code> in
	  an arbitrary order to obtain parameter-like objects and
	  arbitrary objects, the new values, respectively.  The body
	  is evaluated and the values of its last expression are
	  returned.</p>
        <p>Whenever the dynamic extent of <code>body</code> is entered
	  or left, the parameter-like objects are called with zero
	  arguments in an unspecified order to yield values, the old
	  values.  Each parameter-like object is then called with its
	  respective new value.  Finally, the set of new values is
	  replaced by the set of old values.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The following examples show how the <code>with</code> syntax
      differs from the <code>parameterize</code> syntax:</p>

    <pre>(let ([p (make-parameter 1 (lambda (x) (+ x 1)))])
  (with ([p 4]) (values))
  (p))<span class=result>5</span>

    <h3>Initial Continuations</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	call-in-initial-continuation)</code> library.  The library, in
	addition to the procedures and syntax described here, also
	exports the <code>&uncaught-exception</code> condition type
	and associated procedures from <code>(srfi :226 control
	threads)</code>.</p>

    <p>An <dfn>initial continuation</dfn> is one that consists of a
      single continuation prompt tagged with the default prompt tag
      and with the default abort handler.  Moreover, a single initial
      exception handler is installed in an initial continuation that,
      when invoked on a <code>&amp;serious</code> condition or on a
      non-condition object, aborts to the most recent continuation
      prompt tagged with the default prompt tag and calls its abort handler
      with a thunk that, when evaluated, raises an exception whose
      condition is the object.  When invoked on a
      non-<code>&amp;serious</code> condition object, the initial
      abort handler returns with unspecified values instead.</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> There is usually more than one initial
    continuation.  The primordial thread starts in an initial
    continuation, but new initial continuations are created when new
    threads or new promises are created or when the
    procedure <code>call-in-initial-continuation</code> is invoked
      (see below).</p>

    <p>Executing a top-level program starts with the initial
      continuation.  When values are delivered in the initial
      continuation, the program exits normally.  When an exception is
      raised in the dynamic extent of the abort handler of the initial
      continuation prompt, the program may exit or may provide a
      choice of other options.  It is expected that the initial
      exception handler reports that an exception has been raised, and
      displays information about the condition object that was
      provided.</p>

    <p>This extends the semantics of <code>raise</code>.</p>

    <dl class="entries">

    <h3>Promises</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	promises)</code> library. The library, in addition to the
      procedures and syntax described here, also exports
      the <code>&uncaught-exception</code> condition type and
      associated procedures from <code>(srfi :226 control threads)</code>.</p>

    <p><dfn>Promises</dfn> are objects that can be <dfn>forced</dfn>
      to deliver values or raise exceptions.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="syntax"><code>(delay <span class="token">body</span>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p><i>Syntax:</i>
	  <code><span class="token">Body</span></code> is a body.</p>
	<p><i>Semantics:</i> Evaluates to a promise that behaves as
	  follows when forced in a continuation <var>k</var>: If the
	  promise already has delivered values, the same values are
	  delivered again, and if the promise already has raised an
	  exception, the same exception is raised again in the
	  continuation <var>k</var>.
	  Otherwise, <code><span class="token">body</span></code> is
	  evaluated in an initial continuation.  The parameterization
	  of the initial continuation is the same as the
	  parameterization of the continuation of the
	  original <code>delay</code> expression.  When values are
	  delivered to the initial continuation and the promise still
	  hasn't delivered values or has raised an exception, the
	  values are delivered to the continuation in which the
	  promise was forced.  Otherwise, the already delivered values
	  are delivered again, or the already raised exception is
	  raised again in the continuation <var>k</var>.  When an
	  exception is raised in the dynamic extent of the abort handler of
	  the continuation prompt of the initial continuation and the
	  promise still hasn't delivered values or has raised an
	  exception, a continuable exception of
	  type <code>&uncaught-exception-condition</code> whose reason
	  is the object is raised in the continuation <var>k</var>.
	  Otherwise, the already delivered values are delivered again,
	  or the already raised exception is raised again in the
	  continuation <var>k</var>.</p>

	<p>If a call to <code>force</code> occurs in tail context
	  during the evaluation
	  of <code><span class="token">body</span></code>, it is
	  effectively a tail call.</p>

	<p>All operations involved in forcing except for the
	  evaluation of the body are required to be atomic.</p>

	<p><i>Note: </i> The extra requirement about calls
	  to <code>force</code> in tail contexts makes the
	  extra <code>delay-force</code> syntax
	  of <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> (see
	  also <cite>SRFI 45</cite>, where it
	  is called <code>lazy</code>) unnecessary.</p>

	  one-argument procedure also named <code>make-promise</code> that
	  behaves as the <code>make-promise</code> procedure defined
	  here when applied to a single non-promise object.  As the
	  semantics of <code>make-promise</code>
	  in <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> makes it mostly useless and
	  does not allow the obvious generalization to multiple
	  values, we have decided to break compatibility for the
	  better.

    </dl>

    <p><i>Note:</i>
      <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> includes the unfortunate
      requirement that the body of a <code>delay</code> form has to be
      evaluated in the dynamic environment of the call
      to <code>force</code>.  This makes the result of forcing a
      promise dependent on the time when the promise is forced even in
      purely functional code.  As has already been observed Marc
      Feeley during the discussion period of <cite>SRFI 39</cite>, the
      more consistent semantics would have been to evaluate the body
      of a <code>delay</code> form in the parameterization of that
      form.  The <code>delay</code> syntax defined in this
      specification has the more consistent semantics and is breaking
      compatibility with <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> for what we
      think is the better.  The semantics defined here also work well
      in the presence of capturing and applying continuations.  In
      fact, with regard to the dynamic environment, the semantics of
      promises are now equivalent to that of threads.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	exceptions)</code> library.</p>

    <p>Conceptually, each continuation contains at least one
      otherwise inaccessible exception handler stack continuation
      mark, whose value is a list of exception handlers,
      which are one-argument procedures.  The <dfn>exception handler
      stack</dfn> of a continuation is the value of the most recent
      exception handler stack continuation mark in the continuation.
      The exception handler stack of the current continuation is
      the <dfn>current exception handler stack</dfn>.
      The <dfn>current exception handler</dfn> is the first element of
      the current exception handler stack.  An exception handler
      (procedure) is <dfn>installed</dfn> in a continuation by
      recording the exception handler stack of the continuation,
      constructing a new exception handler stack by prepending the
      exception handler to be installed to the recorded exception
      handler stack, and annotating the continuation with an exception
      handler stack continuation mark whose value is the new exception
      handler stack.  The most recent exception handler
      is <dfn>removed</dfn> in a continuation by recording the
      exception handler stack of the continuation, constructing a new
      exception handler stack by removing the first element of the
      recorded exception handler stack, and annotating the continuation
      with an exception handler stack continuation mark whose value is
      the new exception handler stack.</p>

    <p>The semantics of

    <h3>Time Objects</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	times)</code> library.  The time type defined in this library is used in <code>(srfi
	:226 control threads)</code> for timeout arguments in various procedures.</p>

    <p>The specification of this library is minimal to make it
      compatible with existing and future Scheme time APIs.</p>

    <p><dfn>Time objects</dfn> or simply <dfn>times</dfn> represent an
       absolute time (in the process' proper time).</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> Specifying a minimal temporal resolution of time
      objects is outside the scope of this minimal library.  For the
      purpose of their use as timeout arguments, it is recommended
      that the minimal resolution of time objects is at least a millisecond.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(time? <var>obj</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd><p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <code><var>obj</var></code> is
      a time object, <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(current-time)</code></dt>
      <dd><p>Returns the absolute time at the call
      to <code>current-time</code> as a time object.</p></dd>
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(seconds+ <var>time</var> <var>x</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd><p>Returns <code><var>x</var></code> seconds in the future
      of <code><var>time</var></code> as a time object.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> If <code><var>x</var></code> is a negative
	real number, the returned time is actually in the past
	of <code><var>time</var></code>.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> Future SRFIs detailing time objects may want
	  to add a
	  procedure <code>(nanoseconds+ <var>time</var> <var>n</var>)</code>
	  where the time offset is not a real number measuring seconds
	  but an integer measuring nanoseconds.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Threads</h3>

    <p>This section describes the <code>(srfi :226 control
	threads)</code> library.  The library is compatible and mostly
      API-compatible with <cite>SRFI 18</cite>.  For detailed
      examples and a detailed rational, please see that SRFI.  The
      author of this document does not claim any additional major
      contributions; in fact, a lot of text from <cite>SRFI
	18</cite> was copied verbatim or mostly verbatim.</p>

    <p>The concepts of a <i>thread</i>, a <i>mutex</i>, and a
      condition variable are described in the corresponding
      subsections below.  As in <cite>SRFI 18</cite>, we do not
      require specific fairness constraints from implementations of
      this SRFI.  Please see <cite>SRFI 18</cite> for more comments on
      fairness.</p>

    <p>The API described in this sections differs from the API provided by <cite>SRFI 18</cite> in the following points:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Neither threads, mutexes, nor condition variables possess
	  a <code>name</code> field.  If such information is needed
	  for debugging purposes, a weak hash table can be used
	  instead for mutexes or condition variables.  For threads,
	  the thread type can be extended by arbitrary
	  fields.</p></li>
      <li><p>Neither threads, mutexes, nor condition variables
	  possess <code>specific</code> fields.  If these are needed
	  for mutexes or condition variables, weak hash tables can be
	  used instead.  For threads, the thread type can be extended
	  by arbitrary fields.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this SRFI
	  describes thread locals as a mechanism to associate data
	  with threads.  In fact, thread locals allow library-specific
	  and not only application-specific data as the
	  thread-specific field of <cite>SRFI 18</cite>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The interface for (absolute) time objects does not have a
	  notion of an implementation-dependent <i>epoch</i>.  In particular, there are no procedures
	  <code>time->seconds</code> and <code>seconds->time</code>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The procedures related to exception handling contained
	  in <cite>SRFI 18</cite> are described elsewhere in this
	  document.</p></li>
      <li><p>The exception objects of <cite>SRFI 18</cite> are
	  replaced by equivalent condition objects following the hierarchy
	  of standard condition types of <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite>.</p></li>
      <li><p>The procedure <code>thread-join!</code> does not have the
          optional <code><var>timeout-val</var></code> argument.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <dfn>timeout</dfn> is either represented by a time object
      or by <code>#f</code>.  If it is <code>#f</code>,
      an absolute time lying infinitely far in the future is
      represented (meaning effectively no timeout).  A missing
      optional timeout value defaults to <code>#f</code>.</p>

    <h4>Threads</h4>

    <p>A <dfn>thread</dfn> is a Scheme value of a specific type,
      representing a virtual processor which shares object space with all other threads.</p>

    <p> A <dfn>running</dfn> thread is a thread that is currently
    executing. There can be more than one running thread on a
    multiprocessor machine.  A <dfn>runnable</dfn> thread is a thread
    that is ready to execute or running.  A thread
    is <dfn>blocked</dfn> if it is waiting for a mutex to become
    unlocked, an I/O operation to become possible, the end of
    a <i>sleep</i> period, etc.  A <dfn>new</dfn> thread is a thread
    that has not yet become runnable.  A new thread becomes runnable
    when it is started.  A <dfn>terminated</dfn> thread is a thread
    that can no longer become runnable (but "deadlocked" threads are
    not considered terminated).

    <p>The only valid transitions between the thread states are from
      new to runnable, between runnable and blocked, and from any
      state to terminated.  Any attempt to cause an invalid transition
      raises an assertion violation.</p>

    <p><i>Remark:</i> The above assumes an implementation that

    <h4>Mutexes</h4>

    <p>A <dfn>mutex</dfn> is a Scheme value of a specific type,
      representing a mutual exclusion device, also known as a lock and
      binary semaphore.</p>

    <p>A mutex can be in one of four states: <dfn>locked</dfn>
      (either <dfn>owned</dfn> or not owned) and <dfn>unlocked</dfn>
      (either <dfn>abandoned</dfn> or not abandoned).  An attempt to
      lock a mutex only succeeds if the mutex is in an unlocked state,
      otherwise the current thread must wait. A mutex in the
      locked/owned state has an associated <dfn>owner thread</dfn>,
      which by convention is the thread that is responsible for
      unlocking the mutex (this case is typical of critical sections
      implemented as "lock mutex, perform operation, unlock mutex").
      A mutex in the locked/not-owned state is not linked to a
      particular thread.  A mutex becomes locked when a thread locks
      it using the <code>mutex-lock!</code> primitive.  A mutex
      becomes unlocked/abandoned when the owner of a locked/owned
      mutex terminates.  A mutex becomes unlocked/not-abandoned when a
      thread unlocks it using the <code>mutex-unlock!</code>
      primitive.  The mutex primitives specified in this SRFI do not
      implement <i>recursive</i> mutex semantics; an attempt to lock a
      mutex that is locked implies that the current thread must wait
      even if the mutex is owned by the current thread (this can lead
      to a deadlock if no other thread unlocks the mutex).</p>

      <dd>
	<p>If <code><var>owner-thread</var></code> is not given, it defaults to <code>#f</code>.</p>
	<p>If <code><var>mutex</var></code> is currently locked, the
	  current thread waits until it is unlocked or until the timeout
	  is reached.  If the timeout is reached, <code>#f</code> is
	  returned.  Otherwise, <code><var>mutex</var></code> becomes
	  locked with <code><var>owner-thread</var></code> as the owner
	  unless <code><var>owner-thread</var></code> is terminated, in which
	  case <code><var>mutex</var></code> becomes
	  unlocked/abandoned.</p>
	<p>After changing the state of the mutex,
	  an <code>&abandoned-mutex</code> condition object is raised if the
	  mutex was unlocked/abandoned before the state change,
	  otherwise <code>mutex-lock!</code> returns <code>#t</code>.</p>

      <dd>
	<p>Unlocks the mutex by making it unlocked/not-abandoned.  If
	  <code><var>condition-variable</var></code> is supplied, the
	  current thread is blocked and added to the
	  <code><var>condition-variable</var></code> before
	  unlocking <code><var>mutex</var></code>; the thread can
	  unblock at any time but no later than when an appropriate
	  call to <code>condition-variable-signal!</code> or
	  <code>condition-variable-broadcast!</code> is performed (see below), and
	  no later than the <code><var>timeout</var></code>.  If there
	  are threads waiting to lock this mutex, the scheduler
	  selects a thread, the mutex becomes locked/owned or
	  locked/not-owned, and the thread is unblocked. <code>mutex-unlock!</code>
	  returns <code>#f</code> when the timeout is reached, otherwise it
	  returns <code>#t</code>.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> It is not an error to unlock an unlocked mutex
	  and a mutex that is owned by any thread.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> The reason the thread can unblock at any time
	  (when <code><var>condition-variable</var></code> is
	  supplied) is the handling of interrupts (see
	  the <code>thread-interrupt!</code> procedure below).  After a
	  thread blocked on a condition-variable has handled such an
	  interrupt, it would be wrong for the scheduler to return the
	  thread to the blocked state because any calls
	  to <code>condition-variable-broadcast!</code>  during the
	  interrupt will have gone unnoticed.  It is necessary for the
	  thread to remain runnable and return from the call to
	  <code>mutex-unlock!</code> with a result of <code>#t</code>.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> <code>mutex-unlock!</code> is related to the
	  <i>wait</i> operation on condition variables available in
	  other thread systems. The main difference is that <i>wait</i>
	  automatically locks the mutex just after the thread is
	  unblocked. This operation is not performed
	  by <code>mutex-unlock!</code>  and so must be done by an
	  explicit call to <code>mutex-lock!</code>.  This has the
	  advantages that a different timeout and exception handler can
	  be specified on the <code>mutex-lock!</code> and <code>mutex-unlock!</code> operations and the
	  location of all the mutex operations is clearly apparent.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Condition variables</h4>

    <p>A <dfn>condition variable</dfn> is a Scheme value of a specific type,
      representing a set of blocked threads.</p>

    <p>The blocked threads represented by a condition variable are
      waiting for a certain condition to become true.  When a thread
      modifies some program state that might make the condition true,
      the thread unblocks some number of threads (one or all depending
      on the primitive used) so they can check the value of the
      condition.  This allows complex forms of inter-thread
      synchronization to be expressed more conveniently than with
      mutexes alone.</p>

    <p><i>Note:</i> The term <i>condition variable</i>, while
      well-established, is misleading as it describes not a variable, but an object.</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="entry"><code>(make-condition-variable)</code><span class="type">procedure</span></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>Returns a new empty condition variable.</p>

      <dd>
	<p>If there are threads blocked on <code><var>condition-variable</var></code>, the
	scheduler selects a thread and unblocks it. The
	procedure <code>condition-variable-signal!</code> returns
	  unspecified values.</p>
	<p><i>Note: </i> As there are no fairness constraints imposed
	  on the scheduler by this SRFI, the scheduler may always select
	  the same thread to unblock it.  If in doubt, use <code>condition-variable-broadcast!</code> instead.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="entry"><code>(condition-variable-broadcast! <var>condition-variable</var>)</code><span class="type">procedure</span></dt>

    <h3>Portability</h3>

    <p>Implementing the control operators presented in this SRFI
      solely in terms of the facilities provided in <cite>R<sup>6</sup>RS</cite> or
      <cite>R<sup>7</sup>RS</cite> is not possible.</p>

    <h3 id="sample-implementation">Sample Implementation</h3>

    <p>The sample implementation accompanying this SRFI demonstrates
      how the control operators can be implemented on top of a small
      set of primitives.  If in doubt, it favors simplicity and
      clarity over speed.</p>

    <p>The small set of primitives that have to be provided are as follows:</p>

    <dl class="entries">
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(%call-with-current-continuation <var>proc</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>It is an error if <code><var>proc</var></code> is not a
	procedure taking a single argument.</p>
	<p>Calls <code><var>proc</var></code> with the current undelimited continuation.</p>
	<p>If a call to <code>%call/cc</code> occurs in a tail
	context, the call to <code><var>proc</var></code> is also in a
	  tail context.</p>
	<p>An undelimited continuation is represented by a
	  procedure <code><var>k</var></code> that, when it is later
	  called, abandons whatever undelimited continuation is in
	  effect at that later time and instead reinstates the
	  continuation that is represented by it.</p>

	<p><i>Note:</i> The
	  primitive <code>%call-with-current-continuation</code>
	  neither supports <code>dynamic-wind</code> nor continuation
	  barriers.  It can thus be viewed as
	  the <a href="#clinger"><cite>R4RS</cite></a> procedure with
	  the name <code>call-with-current-continuation</code>.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(%call-in-continuation <var>k</var> <var>thunk</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>Abandons whatever undelimited continuation is in effect,
	  and calls <code><var>thunk</var></code> with the undelimited
	  continuation represented by <code><var>k</var></code> as the
	  continuation of the call.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt class="procedure"><code>(%continuation=? <var>k<sub>1</sub></var> <var>k<sub>2</sub></var>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>Returns <code>#t</code> if the undelimited continuation
	  represented by <code><var>k<sub>1</sub></var></code> is the
	  same as the undelimited continuation represented
	  by <code><var>k<sub>2</sub></var></code>,
	  and <code>#f</code> otherwise.</p>
	<p><i>Note:</i> Procedure equivalence with respect to the
	  standard predicates <code>eq?</code>, <code>eqv?</code>,
	  and <code>equal?</code> is unspecified at least in some
	  versions of the Scheme programming language.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="syntax"><code>(%case-lambda-box <span class="token">expression</span> [<span class="token">formals</span>
	  <span class="token">body</span>] ...)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p><i>Syntax:</i>
	  <code><span class="token">Expression</span></code> is an
	  expression,
	  the <code><span class="token">formals</span></code> are a
	  formal parameter list and
	  the <code><span class="token">bodies</span></code> are
	  bodies.</p>

	<p><i>Semantics:</i>
	  When a <code>%case-lambda-box</code> expression is evaluated,
	  it first
	  evaluates <code><span class="token">expression</span></code>,
	  stores the resulting value in a new location, and then
	  returns a procedure that when later called with some
	  arguments behaves as if the procedure were created by
	  evaluating <code>(case-lambda [<span class="token">formals</span> <span class="token">body</span>] ...)</code>
	  and that is tagged with the new location.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt class="procedure"><code>(%case-lambda-box-ref <var>proc</var> <var>obj</var>)</code></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>If <var>proc</var> is a procedure tagged with a location,
	  the <code>%lambda-box-ref</code> procedure returns the value
	  stored in this location, and <code>obj</code> otherwise.</p>
      </dd>

    </dl>

    <h3>Other Implementations</h3>

    <p>A lot of the control operators of this SRFI are natively
    implemented in Racket.  A high-performance implementation of
    continuation marks is described in <a href="#flatt"><cite>Compiler
    and runtime support for continuation marks</cite></a>.</p>

    <h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>This SRFI borrows heavily from Racket's collection of control
    operators.</p>

    <p>The sample implementation builds upon the ideas presented
      in <cite>A Monadic Framework for Delimited
      Continuations</cite> and found in Racket's CS
      implementation.</p>

    <p>Thanks go to Lassi Kortela for pointing out Marc
      Feeley's <cite>A better API for first-class continuations</cite>
      to me, and to John Cowan and Vladimir Nikishkin for <i>very</i>
      careful readings of the first draft and providing me with a lot
      of helpful comments.  The same specifically applies to Marc
      Feeley, without whose experience and insights I wouldn't want to
      have missed.</p>

    <p>I am grateful to Shiro Kawai who is working on an alternative
      implementation of SRFI 226 for his Gauche system.  His comments
      and questions about this SRFI helped a lot to improve it.</p>

    <p>This document uses text copied verbatim from <cite>SRFI
    18</cite>.</p>

    <p>Finally, I would like to thank Arthur A. Gleckler for
      <a href="https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-224/msg/16888913/">encouraging me</a> to write a SRFI covering delimited
      continuations.</p>
