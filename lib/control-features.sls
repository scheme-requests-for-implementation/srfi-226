This reference implementation is meant to show how to implement all the
primitives on a small set of subforms (see control-fratures/*.sls)

Since we need to manage our own delimited continuation, the forms
provided in this implementation cannot run directly on ChezScheme.
Instead, you need to use a runner, 'run' procedure.

$ chezscheme --libdirs lib
Chez Scheme Version 9.5
Copyright 1984-2017 Cisco Systems, Inc.

> (import (except (rnrs (6)) display) (control-features))
> (run (lambda () (call-with-continuation-prompt (lambda () (display 'foo))))
    )

You can also use a small wrapper like this:

;; by Daphne Preston-Kendal
(import (only (chezscheme)
              new-cafe
              lambda
              eval
              interaction-environment)
        (control-features))

(new-cafe (lambda (x) (run (lambda () (eval x (interaction-environment))))))

Suppose you have the above in a file run226.scm.  You can then try
the primitives directly on REPL as follows:

$ chezscheme --libdirs lib --program run226.scm
> (import (except (rnrs (6)) display) (control-features))
> (call-with-continuation-prompt (lambda () (display 'foo)))
foo
